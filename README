To compile the file just type: make
	- which will create a executable named "mycity"

To run just type: ./mycity
    - it should output a pdf file "mycity.pdf"

To clean just type: make clean
    - it should remove all the files (city.cmi, city.cmx, mycity, city.o,
	  mycity.pdf)  except the source.
